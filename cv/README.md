# Azure Cognitive Service & OpenCV

### Face detection using Azure Cognitive Services with a Raspberry Pi

You will need:
1) Azure Account with a face api (easy peasy to setup) 
2) pip install cognitive_face
3) Obviously a raspberry pi with a camera

By now I assume you already know how to enable the camera, you have both your face api key and region.

Modify the azure_keys.py with your face_api_key and region

### Run the microsoft sample

python azure_cognitiveservices_face1.py 

For the raspberry pi demo try:

python azure_cognitiveservices_face_raspi.py 


#### Work in progress
